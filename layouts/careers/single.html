      <h3 class="">About CyberFortress</h3>
      <p class="is-size-6">
        CyberFortress was formed to be a new kind of company to tackle a big
        problem. Insurance is one of the most painful and hated experiences in
        modern life. We want to change that. But we don’t think we can change
        the insurance industry without first changing ourselves. So we have
        thrown out a lot of the startup playbook: No founder dictators.
        No managers. No vesting handcuffs. No work obsession leading to burnout.
        No living in a future that doesn’t exist.
      </p>
      <p class="is-size-6">
        We are a community of owners engaged in a common project and governed
        through thoughtful and open debate rather than top-down managers. We
        want every employee-owner to have a rich life of which work is an
        integral and fulfilling part.
