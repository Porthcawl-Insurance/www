          The Better Business Bureau surveyed 1100 small- and medium-sized businesses
          in North America to measure the level of adoption of certain cybersecurity
          practices and put together a cybersecurity framework for the benefit of small
          businesses. You can use this report to see how you stack up with your peers
          in terms of cybersecurity as well as get ideas for new technologies and
          practices to implement.

          Hiscox is one of the most respected business insurance companies in the world.
          For the past several years, they have conducted a worldwide survey of businesses
          of all sizes on all things cyber. Their study is really thorough and we recommend
          that you read through it to get a sense of the true impact of cybercrime.

          This is the Congressional testimony of Robert Luft, a member of the leadership
          council of the National Small Business Association, concerning the cyber threats
          to small businesses and the role cyber insurance can play in mitigating them.
          Luft isnâ€™t an insurance industry insider or a cybersecurity professional.
          He himself is a small business owner, and as a result, he speaks from experience
          and an intimate understanding of the challenges small business owners face.
