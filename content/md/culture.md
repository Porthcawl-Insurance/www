CyberFortress was formed to be a new kind of company to tackle a big problem. Insurance is one of the most painful and hated experiences in modern life. We want to change that. But we don’t think we can change the insurance industry without first changing ourselves. So we have thrown out a lot of the startup playbook: No founder dictators. No managers. No vesting handcuffs. No work obsession leading to burnout. No living in a future that doesn’t exist.

## What is a culture?
---

#### A culture is a group of people bound together by a collective narrative and common values governed by norms
* **A group of people:** An individual is not a culture. A romantic relationship is not a culture. A friendship is not a culture. A culture emerges out of a multiplicity of people who encounter one another regularly in a common task or setting.
* **Bound by a collective narrative:** Human beings derive meaning from narrative. A culture is bound together through a shared narrative that forms a worldview.
* **With common values:** Values are a collection of facts about the world that represent a conception of the Good. This conception of the Good is the core of a worldview.
* **Governed by norms:** Norms are standards that govern behavior. They can be codified or not, but without norms, a culture would be torn apart by the desires of individuals. Norms must flow out of values.

#### What you do and how you do it
* Culture is not only what you do but how you do it. The two cannot be separated.
* If a narrative, worldview, conception of the Good, and values do not inform and govern the norms of the culture, then they are not real.
* Separate narratives, worldviews, conceptions of the Good, and values for a mission and for how that mission is accomplished turns the entire thing into a lie
* This is all to say: Cultures possess an *internal unity*, of purpose and of practice, of the long-term and the day-to-day

## Narrative
---

#### Our narrative is comprised of three layers
1. Tech industry has not innovated culturally or organizatioanlly, perpetuating flaws in the corporate form that have resulted in widespread immiseration
2. Small business is the bedrock of the American economy; the internet is its greatest asset but is also its greatest threat
3. Existing small business insurance is anti-customer and cyber risk is the best entry point to start fixing that

### Part 1 - The flawed corporate form

#### Tech industry hasn't innovated culturally
* Despite the lionization of innovation in the tech industry, corporate culture and organization has remained stagnant and mired in the past
* Employees are seen as interchangeable assets rather than partners and owners
* The assumptions of 19th century industrial organizations remain at the foundation of 21st century tech companies including, most notably employee surveillance, maximization of working hours, and contractual wage relationships
* Benefits like snacks and on-site gyms, perhaps the central cultural contribution of the technology industry, only serve to perpetuate the unjust underlying relationships
* Managerialism has penetrated tech companies, stifling innovation and producing large, dehumanizing bureaucracies
* "We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters."--Peter Thiel

#### Tech industry has lifted greed to new heights
* Greed has become a primary motivation for entering the tech industry
* Large pools of highly mobile capital have changed management priorities to be focused on short-term financial results at the expense of fundamentals and employees
    * Employees stick around for options to vest
    * Founders want to build a company to exit as quickly as possible in order to cash out on a      fortune
    * Notions of “disruption” and “changing the world” are forms of moral self-exculpation
    * Any sense of serving the public good, of solving problems that need to be solved, has largely been lost

#### The result of this lack of cultural innovation is misery
* “The best minds of my generation are trying to get people to click on ads. That sucks.”—Jeff Hammerbacher
* New addictions have been created - streaming, online shopping, smartphones, social media
* Netflix at nearly [40% employee burnout rate](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurencebradford/2018/06/19/why-we-need-to-talk-about-burnout-in-the-tech-industry/) is best in class for tech companies
* Bureaucracy has become the dominant mode of organization in the United States and tech companies are no different, despite rhetoric about 'lean' startups, leading to the proliferation of bullshit jobs within the heart of the technology industry
* **Result:** the decimation of the Bay Area - [nearly half of its residents want to leave](https://www.sacbee.com/news/business/article212449489.html)

#### Economic dislocation undermines American society
* Since the 1970s, economic dislocation has been a powerful force in American life
* Tech industry treats dislocation and disruption as unfettered goods when they are not
* Flexibility has increased to an unhealthy level, producing huge amounts of contractual labor and quasi- unemployment, contributing to inequality and a sense of alienation
* Social cohesion and stability have been undermined

#### The corporate form needs to be updated
* A corporation is a form of collective disclosure in the public realm by the corporate person, and this sense of collective effort must be prioritized
* A corporate person is made up of capital and labor and must serve and be owned by both
* Widespread ownership of a corporation by engaged shareholders and workers is how some of the dislocation and alienation engendered by the past 40 years, perpetuated by tech companies, can be overcome
* Employees, and not just “senior executives”, must have a hand in defining strategy, making decisions, and running the company
* Corporations must recover a sense of serving the public good, of coming into being to solve a problem that should be solved and not to create new needs, exploit vices, or optimize for the elite

### Part 2 - Small business and the internet

#### Small business is the bedrock of the American economy
* Every large corporation was once a small business
* Every community, regardless of size, is anchored by the businesses unique to that community
* Small businesses form 99% of all businesses in the United States
* As a result, without a healthy, nationwide ecosystem of small businesses, the American economy would perish

#### The internet is not only the greatest opportunity but also the greatest threat for small business today
* The internet is vital to virtually every small business; the internet is arguably the greatest *potential* for small businesses
* But cyberspace is the major threat to small businesses, not burglary, a fire, or someone slipping in the bathroom,
* Whether it's an accidental leak, a malicious attack, or social engineering, the potential loss from a cyber event is enormous
* Small businesses can only unlock the potential of digital technology if the threat that it poses can be mitigated; otherwise they will either refuse to adopt new technology or continue to be devastated by cyber events

### Part 3 - The existing insurance industry is anti-customer

#### Insurance is essential to survival
* If companies can't mitigate certain risks, then they will be killed in the cradle by things they can't control or foresee
* Insurance is the best way to manage the hard-to-control or unforeseeable risk because it is straightforward risk transfer that has been used for thousands of years
* If small businesses don't purchase insurance, they leave themselves exposed to catastrophes and losses they will never see coming and which aren't part of their core operations

#### The insurance industry is fundamentally anti-customer
* The business model of the insurance industry is simple: hold on to as much client money for as long as possible to generate as much investment income  as possible
* This business model is not aligned with the needs of 21st century small businesses
* A cyber event can cripple a small business, requiring immediate attention and deep technical expertise, not a weeks-long claims process without technical help

#### Existing insurance ecosystem is strangling cyber
* Business insurance is rife with information overload; the insurance-buying and renewal processes can take weeks and involve dozens of pages of forms filled with legalese
* Brokers and agents aren't technologists and don't understand the threats facing companies and the right coverage
* Companies don't know what they are getting with a cyber policy and don't trust it as a result
* Businesses are reluctant to purchase additional coverages or investigate new ones because of how frustrating and painful the existing process is

#### CyberFortress was born to fill this gap
* 12 years in data security for small business has positioned us to understand the data protection challenges faced by small business and how risk transfer can help solve them

## Mission
---

#### Eliminate the pain of commercial insurance for SMB
Utilize digital technology to build a new insurance carrier from the ground up:

* A new relationship with the insured
  * New application process
  * New claims experience
  * Ongoing feedback and risk mitigation services for insureds
* Predicated on a new model for cyber risk

#### Pro-customer small business insurance
* **Easy to understand:** What is covered and what isn't written in clear language
* **Easy to buy:** Get started with a minimum of information and a clear path on what else is needed
* **Affordable:** Price is always an issue. small businesses have limited IT budgets for protection before a breach. They will likely have little budget for post breach protection
* **Easy to file claim:** If you've been breached and need to file a claim, you've already got a lot going on. The last thing you need is a difficult claims process
* **Continuous value provided:** not just set and forget; helpful and proactive
* **Provides peace of mind:** If we do all of the above and do it well, our customers will have the peace of mind that they are covered

## Values
---

#### #1 Be present
* While we are building the insurance carrier of the future we build it in the present moment; one step at a time
* We don't live for a future that doesn't exist but rather work to have a meaningful present
* We don't work solely for the exit

#### #2 Be curious
* We always ask questions and encourage those around us to ask questions and pursue their inquiries to the fullest
* It is always ok to question things - especially the basic assumptions we make; what is true changes over time
* We are eager to listen and hear a perspective different to our own
* Curiosity is not only directed at external things and subjects but also internally; reflecting is as important as doing

#### #3 Embrace the courage to be vulnerable
* We show up and put ourselves out there to be seen - good and bad; authentically, without judgment
* Part of being courageous and vulnerable is stumbling and falling short
* When we stumble, we remember that is part of the process and we are not alone; we pick ourselves up and carry on
* When we see someone else stumble, we don't do for them what they can do for themselves, but we are there to support them if they cannot do it alone

#### #4 Be aware
* We strive to understand ourselves and our patterns of behavior; we look to better ourselves
* We look inward at our strengths and weaknesses, and look to our team members to complement these
* We strive to know and communicate our needs to each other
* We show appreciation and gratitude, not just for noteworthy achievements or at significant milestones, but day-in and day-out for things large and small
* While we value critical thinking, we strive to maintain an awareness of our critical patterns and are careful not to fetishize critical thinking in order to ensure a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable contributing, can thrive in the moment, and experience flow

#### #5 Be an owner
* We seek to create a community of owners, not a caste system of owners and wage-laborers
* Ownership is what binds us together in this common project
* Ownership is a privilege that carries the responsibility and duty to act like an owner: to work for the long-term, to put the collective above your individual interests and desires, and to carry and contribute to our common culture

#### #6 Be useful
* Life is not about what you can get but about who you can serve and this is true for all persons - natural and corporate
* We strive to build something great that people use that helps them where they actually need help
* We strive to see the bigger picture of how our work connects to the lives of others

#### #7 Trust yourself; trust your coworkers
* Everyone is at CyberFortress for a reason; everyone has a purpose
* We trust our coworkers to get the job done, respect their expertise, and support them; we don't micromanage anyone else
* We ask for help if we need it and help others when they ask; we don't judge others for asking a question or making a mistake and don't try to fix their mistakes for them if they haven't asked us to do so
* A healthy back-and-forth with others about our work, role, and decisions is essential to performing well; we aren't hostile to feedback
* We celebrate our mistakes as a necessary step to building something great
* We don't misrepresent ourselves or our intentions to one another or anyone outside the organization

#### #8 Play is an integral part of work
* Play is not antithetical to work but an essential part of working life
* Play enables creativity, innovation, free expression, and learning
* Humor and joy are bound up with play; laughter should be heard in the workplace

#### #9 Work is an integral part of life
* We reject the concept of a work-life balance, but not because we want work to overwhelm every aspect of our lives: on the contrary, we want people to have rich and varied lives
* We reject the concept of a work-life balance because work is an integral part of life, not a realm opposed to life, and so we want work to be not only fulfilling, but integrated with the entirety of our lives
* We want work to reinforce our energy and commitment to other areas of our lives and we want other areas of our lives to reinforce our energy and commitment to work

## Principles
---

#### We have three sections of principles
* 1. The common good - principles concerned with binding us together as equals in a common project
* 2. Anti-bureaucracy - principles concerned with making sure bureaucracy never takes root at CyberFortress
* 3. Quality of life - principles concerned with enhancing our quality of life

### Part 1 - The Common Good

#### Make owners; Act like an owner
* Everyone at the company receives equity in the company; this equity is a meaningful and standardized portion of everyone's salary
* Sharing ownership in the company is how we ensure that individuals are oriented towards the long-term and bound together in this common project
* This ownership must be real and substantive; not just the cherry on top of a compensation package
* Owners clean up the office, live the culture, and care for the long-term interests of the company
* We don't exploit interns, part-time workers, or consultants to fill full-time roles

#### Democratic people management
* Every company requires oversight and authority to function, but most companies invest single individuals, managers, with that responsibility and organize their companies around them
* We see this practice as producing dehumanizing, fragile, and wasteful hierarchies
* So we don't employe anyone whose sole responsibility is to hire, fire, plan for, supervise, surveil, evaluate, coach, optimize, or correct others
* Our mechanism for this oversight and authority is not the judgment of individual managers but a temporary democratic, deliberative body convened for a single purpose and then dissolved
* An temporary, democratic body is empowering and antifragile

#### Equality in the day-to-day
* Everyone sits on the same model of chair at the same model of desk
* Everyone has equal access to resources, tools, training, or benefits
* We don't use resources, tools, training, or benefits to create a caste system; either everybody flies first class or nobody flies first class

#### Standardized Compensation Buckets
* Most companies devote an enormous amount of resources to determining who should get paid what
* At CyberFortress, salaries are not tied to a specific role or type of work; we have standardized compensation buckets made up of salary and immediately vested equity
* Ratio of the salary of the highest paid person to the lowest paid person is fixed at 6:1
* We don't have a standardized raise schedule - great work is rewarded by leveling up to a higher salary which is determined by a panel

#### No performance bonuses
* We don't give performance bonuses because it creates the wrong incentives
* We don't want people coming into work to do great work just to make a short-term payout, to optimize for the present instead of building for the long-term future

#### What diversity means to us
* We do not seek diversity as just a box to check but rather see it as a necessary outcome of pursuing a just work environment
* Everyone we hire has to earn it on their own merit
* The two previous points are not contradictory because we believe that talent is evenly distributed across races, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, and socioeconomic classes
* We also recognize that diversity is not only a racial, ethnic, gender, or sexual identity but extends beyond that to encompass the entirety of one's life experience, patterns of thought, interests, and ways of engaging with the world and other people
* We recognize, however, that certain groups have been marginazlied throughout history and that structural forces restrict these same groups in the present day, producing inequities that we want to rectify through our hiring
* We are also aware of the fact that our organization as it currently stands has failed to achieve these goals and we recognize that the seemingly "passive" replication of existing inequities is itself a form of structural violence alongside active prejudice and discrimination
* We hope to achieve our goal of a diverse workplace by casting as wide a net as possible in our hiring and make sure that people of all backgrounds know about, and feel welcome at, CyberFortress
* We are open to any and all feedback, criticism, and suggestions about how we can do this better

### Part 2 - Anti-Bureaucracy

#### Fight the python of process
* Bureaucracy is a cancer, a form of spiritual violence that infects an organization and contorts the imaginations of its members; it is to be fought at every moment
* Bureaucracy is not necessary to accomplish complex, large-scale endeavors; in fact it is an impediment to doing so
* Instead of creating a bureaucracy, we hire high-performing individuals and give them the freedom to accomplish great work in the manner they see fit, as long as it is consonant with our values

#### Value work done, not titles
* We don't have distinct titles but rather identify as being a member of a team
* Each team member has their own distinct role and responsibilities - these roles are all vital
* Some team members will have more experience and responsibility than others on the team; this gives them more influence but not more direct authority; they are the 'first among equals', not a separate class

#### Context, not control
* An RP (responsible person] of a project or a 'first among equals' on a team sets the context: strategy, values, objectives, and assumptions and then lets others find a way to get the job done
* An RP or a 'first among equals' doesn't try to plan an outcome from start-to-finish, override others with top-down decision making, or mandate committees, meetings, and approval requirements to get work done
* Transparency is critical: withholding context, or setting the wrong or insufficient context, sets up an endeavor for failure and withholding problems or obstacles from others does the same

#### Highly aligned, loosely coupled
* Everyone has to be fully aligned on values and strategy, and everyone has to understand how their work is part of the larger mission, but not everyone has to know what everyone else is doing or how they are doing it
* Teams don't question the methods of other teams, unless there are serious value violations involved
* Teams don't have to move in synch with one another or act sequentially; every team should do amazing work whenever possible in order to accomplish our work

#### No bullshit roles
* We only hire fore and maintain roles that are necessary to help us achieve our mission in the present
* There are no pyramids or org charts; there are no points for increasing headcount or budget; doing more with less is celebrated and rewarded
* We reevaluate roles before we reevaluate people - a role that was once a perfect need sometimes changes
* When that happens, we seek to place that person in a different role

#### Adequate performance gets a generous severance package
* Adequate performance is not defined solely by metrics or a formula - what Justice Potter Stewart said about pornography applies to adequate performance: "I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description ['hard-core pornography'], and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But I know it when I see it."
* The company, not the individual, should feel pain for a mistake in the hiring process so every employee will be granted a minimum of 4 months severance

#### Hire only in-demand people
* If it is not believable that a person would be hired within the same market to a similar or better role with similar or bettery pay and status, we do not consider them for hire
* Otherwise their man focus will inevitably become preserving their salary at all costs
* As a valued team member, there is no greater joy than knowing each of your coworkers is working with you purely by choice

#### Be mindful of brilliant jerks
* You can't be comfortable being courageous or vulnerable with a jerk
* You can't be comfortable offering your thoughts and opinions to a jerk
* Jerks are resistant to being aware of their critical patterns

#### Don't design camels
* A camel is what is produced when a committee tries to design a horse
* Each project should have an RP who is responsible for making the final decisions; their expertise and responsibility must be respected

### Part 3 - Quality of life

#### Flexible working
* We value effectiveness over hard owrk
* We do not work 9-5, or have a set number of hours or days in a work week, and we never come to work to be seen working
* Some of us get in early; some of us work late; some thrive in the office; others thrive in solitude; what matters is producing great work in a way consistent with our values
* Being authentically curious involves things that may not look like 'work', such as reading or taking a walk to discuss a subject, but those moments and activities are essential to our company

#### Get away from your desk
* We don't want people to be hunched over their computer for an entire day or to feel like they can't take a break to enjoy the weather or someone else's company
* Go out for lunch or take a walk
* This is part of work

#### Remote work
* Any common project must involve regular physical encounter with all those whom you are joined in that project
* Only through physical proximity do you encounter other people in the fullness of their humanity
* A fully remote workplace is dystopian, isolating, and counter to the inherent sociability of human beings
* Remote work can be used as a tool to enable flexibility, but it can never be an employee's default or sole mode of operation

#### Vacation
* We do not have a set number of vacation days - we take as much as we need
* Minimally everyone must take two 1-week vacations every year
* People need real time to disconnect and replenish their energy and shouldn't be worried about breaking some arbitrary limit of number of vacation days

#### Policy on family obligations
* Former Vice President Joe Biden inadvertently wrote our family obligation policy in an email to his staff: "I would like to take a moment and make something clear to everyone. I do not expect, nor do I want, any of you to miss or sacrifice important family obligations for work. Family obligations include, but are not limited to, family birthdays, anniversaries, weddings, any religious ceremonies such as first communions and bar mitzvahs, graduations, and times of need such as an illness or loss in the family. This is very important to me. In fact, I will go so far s to say that if I find out that you are working with me while missing important family responsibilities, it will disappoint me greatly."

#### Parental leave
* We don't have a fixed parental leave policy - we take as much time as we need
* We come back when we want to come back, not when we think we have to come back to prove to everyone else that we are committed to our job
* In fact, if someone returns before he or she is ready to return, it will create problems for that person, their family, and CyberFortress
* This applies to any parent of a newborn or newly adopted child

#### Wellness
* Health is not just about our physical bodies; we care as much about our minds and souls as we do about our bodies
* With this in mind, we are happy to cover part, or all, of the costs for a wide range of wellness, therapeutic, and spiritual programs
* This includes but is not limited to: religous community memberships, meditation or therapeutic courses and retreats, and a certain number of sessions with a therapist, psychiatrist, or psychoanalyst
* This is not intended to be used for career development, skills training, or vacation

#### Leave of absence
* We recognize that life is unpredictable and that stepping away from work for a period of time might be the right thing to do
* A shorter paid or longer unpaid leave of absence as a result of family difficulties, loss, trauma, substance abuse, mental or physical health, or other personal reasons is not stigmatized but supported wholeheartedly
* We will welcome everyone back from a leave of absence with open arms

#### Location and community
* We recognize that our company does not exist in isolation but rather is enmeshed in a broader community and is dependent upon that community
* We strive to be an engaged, thoughtful, and constructive member of all the communities in which we operate in a way that is consonant with our size
* Our greatest contribution to our community will be to live our culture, share it, and make or inspire the creation of as many owners in our communities
* At this stage, we do not engage in corporate philanthropy
* We encourage everyone at CyberFortress to engage individually with their local community in any form they find inspiring

## Practices and Tools
---

#### How do people join?
* A candidate's abilities are first endorsed by someone at the company with the requisite knowledge, then 3 people are randomly selected to serve on a temporary hiring panel to make a decision on cultural fit; the endorser is not a part of this panel
* The endorser and the panel meet to determine a hiring decision and offer

#### How do people leave?
* After a period of time has elapsed for onboarding, adjustment, and a few projects, a person is eligible to be let go
* A person cannot be let go before there have been multiple discussions about performance and/or cultural fit
* After that point, a person must be nominated to be let go; this nomination must be public and made by a person who has worked with that person regularly on a team or project
* In that event, a temporary panel is convened to determine whether a person should be let go

#### How are people rewarded and honored?
* We reward people by leveling them up
* We don't have any awards or special statuses for the same reason we don't have cash bonuses: they create the wrong incentives
* The essence of our culture is for people to feel honored and rewarded through their participation in this common project

#### How are people disciplined?
* Who is hired, who levels up, and who is fired reveal a company's true values
* Instead of relying on formal mechanisms of discipline, we work with individuals who are struggling in terms of culture or performance
* If, after multiple attempts at a solution, an individual continues to violate our culture in substantive ways or underperform, they are let go with severance

#### How do we recognize and overcome obstacles?
* When problems, challenges, failures, and obstacles arise that, for whatever reason, cannot be resolved by the RP, a 3-person temporary panel is convened to work with the RP to investigate the problem and formulate a solution
* The panel is drawn from believable people and can solicit the input of anyone else at the company

#### How are disputes resolved?
* Every week we have a 'scheduled burn' meeting which is a forum for anyone to share anything that has been frustrating or festering about ourselves, the company, or others with regard to our culture
  * We do this as a way of clearing out the emotional undergrowth that has built up in the preceding week to prevent a blow-up
* A 'group consciousness meeting' is called periodically if, in the course of a scheduled burn meeting, deeper issues have surfaced that need to be addressed

#### How is dissent expressed?
* Openly and often in both formal and non-formal settings
* Scheduled burns and group consciousness meetings are both mechanisms of enabling dissent

#### How do we encourage ourselves to be aware?
* Self-awareness isn't optional but the methods to achieve it vary for each individual
* Some of us have found these various tools for self-awareness helpful: Strengthsfinder; Love Language; Myers-Brigg; Journey Map
* The scheduled burn and group consciousness meetings also help enable awareness

#### How do we encourage people to be vulnerable?
* By being vulnerable ourselves - give before taking, share before asking
* Specific tools include:
  * Journey Map
  * Quaker-style clearness committee
  * Experience sharing

#### How do we encourage curiosity?
* CyberFortress company library
* Company magazine and newspaper subscriptions
* Both are free for all
* Support for professional development

#### Discussion tools and practices
* **'I' statements:** We us 'I' as opposed to 'you' or even 'we' to keep the focus on ourselves and our own experience, feelings, and perceptions to avoid inadvertently projecting on another
* **Calling out:** If someone has done something that we deem to be dismissive, disrespectful, non-present, or in violation of our culture then we call it out in the moment
* **Taking a breath of fresh air:** Stepping out to collect ourselves if we don't feel like we can contribute constructively and meaningfully
* **Giving someone the floor:** If someone seems upset or dismissed but isn't calling out, we preemptively check-in to ask if they want the floor to speak

#### Hiring tests
* Front desk test
* Explain your role to a child test
* Immediacy test
* Stuck in the airport test
* Mind the kids test
* Title test

#### Rehire test
* We use this constantly for ourselves and others: 1. Is the role still valid? 2. Would we rehire the person for this role?
* The role is reflected upon first, then the person
* If a role has changed or disappeared then we work hard to find a place for the person
