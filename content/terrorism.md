**Certified Act of Terrorism Premium** : Included

## **1. Disclosure of Premium**

The portion of the premium attributable to such coverage is shown above.

## **2. Disclosure of Federal Participation in Payment of Terrorism Losses**

However, if aggregate insured losses attributable to terrorist acts certified under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act exceed $100 billion in a calendar year, the Treasury shall not make any payment for any portion of the amount of such losses that exceeds $100 billion.

If aggregate insured losses attributable to terrorist acts certified under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act exceed $100 billion in a calendar year and the Company has met its insurer deductible under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, the Company shall not be liable for the payment of any portion of the amount of such losses that exceeds $100 billion, and in such case insured losses up to that amount are subject to pro rata allocation in accordance with procedures established by the Secretary of the Treasury.
