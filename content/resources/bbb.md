The Better Business Bureau, one of the largest business standards organizations in the country, surveyed 1100 small- and medium-sized businesses in North America to measure awareness of cybersecurity terms and concepts as well as the level of adoption of certain security practices among small- and medium-sized businesses. This report ends with a cybersecurity framework put together by BBB for the benefit of small businesses. You can use this report to see how you stack up with your peers in terms of cybersecurity as well as get ideas for new technologies and practices to implement.
