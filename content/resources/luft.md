This is the Congressional testimony of Robert Luft, a member of the leadership council of the National Small Business Association (NSBA), concerning the cyber threats to small businesses and the role cyber insurance can play in mitigating them. The NSBA is the nationâ€™s oldest small business advocacy organization and represents the interests of voter 65,000 small businesses. Luft isn't an insurance industry insider or a cybersecurity professional. He himself is a small business owner, and as a result, he speaks from experience and an intimate understanding of the challenges small business owners face.
