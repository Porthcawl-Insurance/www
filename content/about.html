					We're building a new kind of online business interruption policy designed
					for small business. Narrowly-focused and parametric in nature, this policy
					will begin paying out within 24 hours of a cyber incident - providing
					valuable cash-on-hand to help our customers weather the immediate storm.
				</p>
				<p class='t-light larger text-center pt-2'>
					<span class='bold'>To do this, we're also building a new way to model online cyber risk.</span>
					We're building a machine that continuously collects the evidence of technology
					choices ecommerce businesses make - thousands of features per domain - and makes
					sense of this noise via machine learning. We believe that it is these behavioral
					vectors over time (not a point-in-time snapshot of a business's technology
					footprint) that best proxy cyber risk. We then use this prediction to determine
					pricing and generate a risk score that any business owner can use to lower
					their risk of downtime.
