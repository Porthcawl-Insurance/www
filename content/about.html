			<p class='bold larger'>CyberFortress is an insuretech startup based in San Antonio, TX.</p>
			<p>We're building a new kind of online business interruption policy designed for small business.</p>
			<p class='pb-4'>Narrowly-focused and parametric in nature, this policy will begin paying out within 24 hours of a cyber incident - providing valuable cash-on-hand to help our customers weather the immediate storm.</p>

			<p class='bold larger'>To do this, we're also building a new way to model online cyber risk.</p>
			<p>We're building a machine that continuously collects the evidence of technology choices ecommerce businesses make - thousands of features per domain - and makes sense of this noise via machine learning.</p>
			<p>We believe that it is these behavioral vectors over time (not a point-in-time snapshot of a business's technology footprint) that best proxy cyber risk.</p>
			<p>We then use this prediction to determine pricing and generate a risk score that any business owner can use to lower their risk of downtime.</p>
