					We're building a new kind of online business interruption policy designed
					for small business. Narrowly-focused and parametric in nature, this policy
					will begin paying out within 24 hours of a cyber incident - providing valuable
					cash-on-hand to help our customers weather the immediate storm.
				</p>
				<p class='t-light pt-2'>
					To do this, we're also building a new way to model online cyber risk.
					We're building a machine that continuously collects the evidence of
					technology choices ecommerce businesses make - thousands of features
					per domain - and makes sense of this noise via machine learning. We
					believe that it is these behavioral vectors over time (not a point-in-time
					snapshot of a business's technology footprint) that best proxy cyber risk.
					We then use this prediction to determine pricing and generate a risk score
					that any business owner can use to lower their risk of downtime.
