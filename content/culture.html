        Insurance is one of the most painful and hated experiences in modern life.
        We want to change that. But we don’t think we can change the insurance
        industry without first changing ourselves. </p>
      <p class=''>
        <span class='larger'>So we have thrown out a lot of the startup playbook:</span><br />
        No founder dictators. No managers. No vesting handcuffs. No work obsession leading to burnout. No living in a future that doesn’t exist.
