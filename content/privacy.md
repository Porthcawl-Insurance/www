# Privacy Policy

## **Introduction**

At CyberFortress Insurance Services US, LLC (“CyberFortress”) we value our relationship with you (“you”, “your”, “your company”). This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) serves to clarify what we do and don’t do with your information. The intention of this Policy is to provide you with the transparency you need to understand our information collection and sharing processes so you can trust us as your insurance provider.

The first thing to know is that **we do not sell** customer information.

We understand the importance of protecting your information, and appreciate your confidence and trust. We make good on that trust by maintaining security over your personal information. We invite you to review this Policy to help you understand how we use and protect your information.

As an insurance provider, we are regulated by Federal and State laws protecting the confidentiality and security of your information, as well as our use and disclosure of it. Whether you are a current, former, or potential customer, CyberFortress treats your information with the same high level of confidentiality and security.

## **Information We Collect**

**Non-public**: In order to provide you with the best products and advice, we request and obtain information from you. This information helps us determine whether and how we can help you meet your goals. As part of that process, we may collect information about you, known as non-public personal information, from you or from other entities, such as credit reporting agencies. Our handling and protection of non-public personal financial and medical information is governed by a wide range of state and federal laws and regulations. We do not disclose your information to third parties other than as allowed by law.

As a valued customer, we work hard to maintain your privacy and are very careful to preserve the private nature of our relationship with you.

Information you provide to us is afforded the same protection whether we receive if from you in writing, by telephone, in conversation with one of our representatives, or via the Internet.

As a matter of policy, we will only disclose your non-public personal financial information to other entities as permitted or required by law.

In the course of our business, we may collect the following non-public personal information about you:

* Information you provide you provide to us in the application process, including such things as your name, address, age, marital status, Social Security Number, annual income, and other financial information.
* Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others, such as additional products or services purchased, etc.
* Information we receive from you or your authorized representative on applications or other forms, in interviews, or by other means, such as information on other insurance policies you may have.
* Information we receive from 3rd party, consumer or other reporting agencies, governmental agencies, employers or others, such as credit reports.

This information allows us to establish and administer your accounts, satisfy certain regulatory requirements, and better understand you so that we may provide you with high quality products and services.

**Public**: In order to analyze your risk for a cyber security incident, we collect publicly available data on the technology you use. Examples include (but are not limited to):

* Separate from the information you provide to us individually via our website, CyberFortress uses technology on our website and in our emails to collect general information about visits to our website as part of our business tracking. This information is used to enhance your website experience and includes, for example, data regarding how you linked to our website, your Internet protocol (IP) address, your browser and/or device type, and your time of visit. This information does not include your name, address, telephone number or email address. CyberFortress may use third-party web analytic and advertising services to assist with collecting and tracking of this information.
* In addition, CyberFortress’ third-party ad servers may use technology that includes technology on websites on which we advertise, to support site tracking, measure site performance, enhance your website experience, and for product marketing. For example, one of our third-party ad servers may place a cookie on your computer that helps to identify your computer when you arrive at or return to our site, to personalize aspects of your experience at our site, and to better understand how visitors like you in aggregate are using our site, all of which helps us to continually improve the experience on our site. This process does not collect personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, telephone number or email address).
* Another use of web beacons and cookies is for CyberFortress to advertise on other websites. In this common practice (sometimes referred to as re-targeting), our third-party ad server or an advertising vendor may use beacons to place cookies on your computer when you visit the CyberFortress websites, in order to display CyberFortress advertising messages to you later on other websites. We do not allow those third-party ad servers or advertising vendors to use beacons on our website to place cookies that will be used to display advertising for any companies other than CyberFortress. To learn more, or to opt-out of this type of targeting by third party ad servers/vendors that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt\_out.asp and http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.
* Lastly, in order to assess your risk of downtime, we gather information on the technology your ecommerce website uses. That information is the basis for our Cyber Risk Score.


## **Information We Disclose**

As a corporate policy, we do not share your non-public personal financial with any non-affiliated third parties for marketing purposes.  We will not share account numbers or policy numbers with nonaffiliated third parties for use in telemarketing, direct mail or email marketing.  We will only disclose non-public personal information about you to certain nonaffiliated third parties, which perform necessary services connected with the administration of our business, or as otherwise permitted or required by law. For example, we may disclose such information to affiliated and non-affiliated insurance companies, insurance agents, reinsurance companies, insurance support organizations, such as consumer reporting agencies, government entities and claims administrators.

We are highly selective in choosing these third parties, and they do not receive access to your information without first agreeing in writing to maintain its confidentiality.  Additionally, these entities will not be authorized to use your information for any purpose other than that authorized by us and allowed by law. Should any of your policies with us terminate, and/or should you become a former customer, we will not disclose any non-public personal financial information about you to any nonaffiliated third parties.

Further, we may also disclose such information as necessary to effect, administer or enforce a transaction that you request or authorize, or in connection with servicing or processing a transaction that you request or authorize.

The following are examples of situations in which we may disclose such information:

* Your information may be passed between us and our agents, appraisers, attorneys, investigators, and others who may be involved in the sales and marketing of CyberFortress products and services, processing of applications, and servicing of policies or claims.
* We provide your policy information to adjusters and other appropriate business entities that provide analysis of your submitted claim.
* We may provide your information to others whom we determine need such information to perform insurance or other professional functions for us. These may include parties helping us with administrative services and reporting agencies.
* If we collect your information as an agent for one of our business partners, we may use it to contact you or make you an offer regarding insurance products that may be of interest to you.

We may supply information as required by search warrant, subpoena, or legal process, to state insurance departments, or other law enforcement or government authorities when required by law, or to protect our own legal interests in the event of suspected illegal or fraudulent activities.

## **Confidentiality and Security**

We maintain appropriate physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to maintain the confidentiality and security of your non-public personal information.  We restrict access to non-public personal information about you to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you.

## **Accuracy of Your Information That We Possess**

We strive to maintain the accuracy of your information.  In order to help us maintain accuracy, you have the right to reasonably access your information.
